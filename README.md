This repo contains a single R script (run_analysis.R) which modifies a dataset which may be found at [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

It produces a tidy dataset contained in *motion_sensor_means_and_stds.txt*. Some additional information about column names and enumerated values for factors are contained in *CodeBook.md*.
